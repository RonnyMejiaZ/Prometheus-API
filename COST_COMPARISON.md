## 🎯 My Recommendation by Use Case

### For School Projects / Demos
**Use: Local + ngrok**
- Completely free
- No limitations
- Perfect for presentations

### For Portfolio / Resume
**Use: Heroku**
- Free public URL
- Looks professional
- Just mention it sleeps after inactivity

### For Production Apps
**Honest answer**: You'll need to pay $7-20/month. Free hosting doesn't exist for production.

## 💡 Why This Matters

### Railway Misleading:
- Advertises "FREE"
- Actually: 500 free hours/month
- Reality: ~20 days running 24/7
- After: You pay $5-20/month

### Heroku is Truly Free:
- 550-1000 free hours/month
- Never asks for payment
- Just app sleeps

---

## 🔍 The Math

### Railway "Free Tier":
```
500 hours ÷ 24 hours/day = ~20 days/month FREE
After: $5-20/month = $60-240/year
```

### Heroku Free:
```
550 hours ÷ 24 hours/day = ~22 days/month FREE
After: Still FREE (just app sleeps)
Cost: $0/year
```

## ✅ Final Verdict

**If you want TRULY FREE:**
1. **Local + ngrok** (best for students)
2. **Heroku** (best for portfolio)

**If Railway/Render:**
- Not free after trial
- Budget $7-20/month

## 📝 Honest Answer to "Is Railway Free?"

**Short answer**: No, not really.

**Long answer**: 
- First 500 hours/month are free
- That's ~20 days running 24/7
- After that: $5-20/month
- Still cheaper than many options
- But NOT "free" for long-term use

**My recommendation**: Use Heroku (actually free) or Local + ngrok (completely free) for school projects.
